# Time-Series-Forecasting-on-Climate-Data-with-RNN-

Climate change is real, and I am passionate about moving towards a more sustainable future. A future where we can live in harmony with animals and plants, without detsroying their habitat. At the current rate, we have only a few years before we can reverse the adverse effects of climate change that we are now seeing today. 

There are uncontrollable fires in Australia, California and Uttarakhand. There are unprecendented floods in Florida, Kerela and Ethiopia. There is a new trans-atlantic route that has opened from Europe to Canada because of the sheer amount of ice that has melted in the past few decades. We have already crossed 400 ppm of Carbon in the atmosphere and if nothing is done soon, we will have passed the point of no return.

So, that's the general objective of this project, to build a neural network that can accurately capture the cycles, trends and seasonality in the climate data. I have tried to implement a relatively simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to forecast the weather.
